# AIOS

We’re building AIOS in public, and we’d love for you to be part of it. You can fork this repo, experiment with your own AI models, or even swap in local LLMs if you prefer.
If you improve the AI’s behavior, add useful features, or integrate better model architectures, feel free to open a pull request — we’re open to merging community-proposed models and ideas
into the core. Whether you’re into system-level hacking, AI pipelines, or UI design, there’s a place for your contribution. Let’s build the future of AI-native operating systems, together.
